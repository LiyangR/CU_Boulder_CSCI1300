In the test cases, they are both admissible because the pecman get same scores by both heuristic functions,
but not consisitent since they have different expanded search nodes(random > euclidean).

All of three heuristics can achieve same scores in bigMaze. 
But, manhattan has least expanded search nodes, and euclidean's is close to manhattan, while random has much more expanded search nodes.
I think we can consider manhattan and euclidean are both good heuristic functions, since random heurisitc doesn't solve a good heuristic
value for A* search and it has to search much more nodes than the other two.

DFS expands least nodes to get the paths since it only searchs one route from start to end. On the other hand, it doesn't searchs optimal
solution because it doesn't give the best path for mediumMaze

BFS expands much more nodes to find the paths because it searchs each node for all the levels. On the other hand, it can gives optimal 
solution for the search problem since it gets higher score for mediumMaze and finds the optimal way.

Uniform Cost search can give optimal solution when we set costs on different paths. This search is much more intelligent while DFS and
BFS don't work on these cases.

A* search always give optimal solution for all cases since it will calculate g(n) and h(n), but it will expands much more nodes than DFS. 
A* search relies on the performance of heuristic functions. We can take manhattan and euclidean algorithms as heuristic functions to 
ensure the performance of A* search.
